# Auto Freckle
> Because manually typing your time tracking is for barbarians

## How do I...?
1. `git clone git@github.com:victor-am/auto-freckle.git`
2. `cp .env.example .env` and fill it in
3. Add the `auto-freckle/bin` dir to your path
4. `auto-freckle 8:00` to log 8 hours using your Wunderlist tasks marked as done today
5. Profit!

## That's lame...
